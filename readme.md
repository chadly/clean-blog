# Clean Blog

A theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) inspired by [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) with a little bit of [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper) mixed in.

The theme supports multiple authors, Ghost 2.0 editor features, and has a placeholder for comments.

## Usage

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/chadly/clean-blog/releases/latest) which includes the compiled css assets and [upload the theme to your Ghost site](https://help.ghost.org/article/31-upload-themes).

## Development

Clone the repo and run the following in a terminal:

```
yarn
yarn run build
```

This will build the less files into `site.css` and package up the theme into the _dist_ directory.
